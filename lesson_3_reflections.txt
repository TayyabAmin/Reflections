When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

I want to create a remote repository because
1. In locall machine my data is insecure, it can be lost anytime.
2. If my data is in remote repository, i can access it anytime anywhere
3. If data is in remote repository, more than one person can work on single project
4. If data is in remote repository, we can easily find bugs


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
